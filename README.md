### Reflection Post

For this project I made a tool to help people with dyslexia read better. I have dyslexia myself so I know how hard reading can be. Letters can feel mixed up and that makes school and other stuff frustrating. I wanted to make something that gives people more control over how text looks so it’s easier to read.

The tool is like a short quiz. You pick the font, size, spacing, background color, and other settings that feel best to you. At the end it shows a reading page that uses all your choices. It’s simple but it works.

Building the site was tricky, I had to redo it after my initial project didnt work. I followed a tutorial that told me to use Nodejs, but it didnt work and it wasnt right for my project (which i only found out in the end). So i scrapped that, which im disappointed about but it forced me to strip the project to the basics. I was able to recreate the project without outside tools or libraries, and with much less code. I think i was over complicating, and following the wrong tutorials. Although it wasted a lot of time, it taught me that I need to pick tutorials more carefully. 

It took some time to make it look good and be centered on the screen. I also had to figure out how to change styles based on what people picked. If I had more time I’d make it into a Chrome extension so people could use it on real websites. I’d also add a way to go back and change answers.I think the project turned out well. It’s helpful and made for real people who need it. I learned a lot and I’m glad I made something useful.
